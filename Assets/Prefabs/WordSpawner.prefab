  word: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise I thought not It
    is not a story the Jedi would tell you It is a Sith legend Darth Plagueis was
    a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence
    the midichlorians to create life He had such a knowledge of the dark side that
    he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying The dark side of the Force
    is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural He became so powerful
    the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course
    he did Unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice
    killed him in his sleep It's ironic he could save others from death but not himself
